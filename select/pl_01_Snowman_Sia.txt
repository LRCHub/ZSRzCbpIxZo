DON'T CRY SNOWMAN

WHO'LL CATCH YOUR TEARS
IF YOU CAN'T CATCH ME DARLING
IF YOU CAN'T CATCH ME DARLING

A PUDDLE OF WATER CAN'T HOLD ME CLOSE BABY
CAN'T HOLD ME CLOSE BABY
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M NEVER LEAVIN'
COS I'M MRS. SNOW
TILL DEATH WE'LL BE FREEZING
YEAH YOU ARE MY HOME
MY HOME FOR ALL SEASONS
SO COME ON LET'S GO
LET'S GO BELOW ZERO
AND HIDE FROM THE SUN
I'LL LOVE YOU FOREVER
OH WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN

AND LIVE HAPPILY
PLEASE DON'T CRY NO TEARS NOW
