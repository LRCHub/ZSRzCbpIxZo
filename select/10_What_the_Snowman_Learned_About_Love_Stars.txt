I am Evan and this is my heart
I am Amy and this is my heart
I am Chris and this is my heart
I am Touque and this is my heart
How the heart bends
And summer, she sends
A sky that refuses to die
With weeds of the sea
That wrap round our knees
And a sun too hot to go down
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
How the heart bends
And summer, she sends
A sky that refuses to die
With weeds of the sea
That wrap round our knees
And a sun too hot to go down
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
You come around
